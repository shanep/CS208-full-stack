# CS208 Full Stack Final Project

## Documentation

- Running the example project is documented [here](docs/example_project.md)
- An example README is provided [here](docs/README_example.md)

Students must **replace** this README with a README that is specific to your
project. **IMPORTANT**: If you do not complete the README, your project will not
be graded, and you will receive a zero. The TA will not guess how to set up,
configure, and run your project.
